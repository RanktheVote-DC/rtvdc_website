  problems from Rank the Vote DC.

## There are two main problems with elections in DC:

1. Communities split their vote & weaken their collective community power.
2. Candidates can win with less than 50% of the vote.

Under our current system, our vote is diluted and our politicians are not held accountable. This has harmed and displaced Black and brown communities economically, culturally, and politically.

As running for office becomes more accessible with Fair Elections, we need a ranked system to free communities to change the game & vote their values.

## Ranked voting helps dissolve these problems

### What is ranked voting?

Ranked voting, or Ranked Choice Voting (RCV), gives voters the option to rank their backup choices. 

**If your 1st choice doesn't win, your vote automatically moves to your next choice.** 

Candidates only win if they build a broad coalition of over 50%.

Diverse communities become free to vote in solidarity & build power together. Ranking preserves Black voting power and combats political displacement by letting communities vote for backup choices without harming their first choice. This tends to elect more women & people of color.

Some extra benefits:

1. Elects more women and people of color
2. Reduces toxic and negative campaigning
3. Makes politicians have to campaign beyond their base and across the city.
