## There are two main problems with elections in DC:

1. Elections can be won without receiving majority support (or over 50%).

*In case you missed it, we explain these problems in-depth on our "[What's wrong with elections in DC?](/problem/)" webpage.*

## Ranked choice voting solves these problems

### What is Ranked Choice Voting (RCV)

Ranked choice voting allows voters to vote for more than one candidate. The voter ranks the candidates they vote for in order of preference.

### Try Ranked Choice Voting (RCV)

To better understand how it works, try ranked choice voting by selecting your choice for the new mascot for the Washington Football Team.*

* Vote for as many mascots as you want.
* Select them in order from your first choice to your last choice.
* Your first choice is your favorite and your last choice is your least favorite.
* If your first choice doesn't win, you'll get to use your second choice. If your second choice doesn't win, you'll get to use your third choice. And so on...
