## Ballot Initiative #83

Working with our neighbors, we've starting the process of letting DC residents vote on whether to make all votes count in DC. This initiative, if we get on the ballot and neighbors vote to approve it, would implement ranked choice voting and end voter disenfranchisement for nearly 75,000 independent voters in DC.
