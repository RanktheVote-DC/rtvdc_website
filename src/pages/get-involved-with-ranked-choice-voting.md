## Speak your truth! Call, email, or DM them and say why you want to rank the vote!

## You can say something like:

## "I'm a DC resident in Ward _, asking for the Councilmember's support for ranked voting to free communities to build voting power together. I hope they will support election equity by cosponsoring the VOICE Act - the new ranked choice voting bill.

## This is a common-sense way to strengthen democracy and build a Future 51st State! We're counting on you to strengthen democracy and the freedom to vote for who we want.

## What is the Councilmember's position on ranked voting?""
