Try out ranked choice voting by selecting your choice for the new mascot for the Washington Football Team.*

## How ranked choice voting works

* Vote for as many mascots as you want.
* Select them in order from your first choice to your last choice.
* Your first choice is your favorite and your last choice is your least favorite.
* If your first choice doesn't win, you'll get to use your second choice. If your second choice doesn't win, you'll get to use your third choice. And so on...
