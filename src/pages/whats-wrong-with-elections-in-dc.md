## Problems with elections in DC

Under our current system, our vote is diluted and our politicians are not held accountable. This has harmed and displaced Black and brown communities economically, culturally, and politically.

As running for office becomes more accessible with Fair Elections, we need a system that frees communities to change the game & vote their values while building community power together.

### The problem for voters

The second problem is that our elections punish voters for voting their values. This is a big problem for citizens who are forced to strategize and pick a candidate based on perceived traits like electability, rather than simply choosing the person they most believe in.

### 1) Communities split their vote & weaken their collective power.



In addition, a voter may believe in one candidate the most, but is worried that they don't have a chance of winning and may be wasting their vote. People don't trust a system that won't let them vote their values.

### 2) Candidates can win with less than 50% of the vote.

Let's say five candidates run for office, and the vote looks like this:

1. **Candidate One**: 29%
2. **Candidate Two**: 21%
3. **Candidate Three**: 20%
4. **Candidate Four**: 18%
5. **Candidate Five**: 12%

In this scenario, Candidate One wins with only 29% of the vote, which means 71% of voters did not choose them. This does not give voters the sense that Candidate One has been given the mandate to lead by the people. 

This creates an opening for the winning candidate's opponents to attack their legitimacy, which hurts their ability to govern as well as the legitimacy of our elections. Since voters can only vote for a single candidate, this creates a zero-sum game that rewards the candidates who run toxic smear campaigns against their opponents.


## How do we fix our elections?

The good news is there is a solution. It's called ranked choice voting (RCV).
