## There are two problems with elections in DC

Under our current system, our vote is diluted and our politicians are not held accountable. This has harmed and displaced Black and brown communities economically, culturally, and politically.

Ranking preserves Black voting power and combats political displacement by letting communities vote for backup choices without harming their first choice. This tends to elect more women & people of color.

As running for office becomes more accessible with Fair Elections, we need a ranked system to free communities to change the game & vote their values.

### The problem for politicians

The first problem with our elections is that they can be won without receiving majority support (or over 50%). This is a big problem for politicians who are trying to govern without facing challenges to their legitimacy.

### The problem for voters

The second problem is that our elections punish voters for voting their values. This is a big problem for citizens who are forced to strategize and pick a candidate based on perceived traits like electability, rather than simply choosing the person they most believe in.

### 1) Elections can be won without receiving majority support (or over 50%).

Five candidates run for office and receive the following share of the votes:

1. **Candidate One**: 29%
2. **Candidate Two**: 21%
3. **Candidate Three**: 20%
4. **Candidate Four**: 18%
5. **Candidate Five**: 12%

In this scenario, Candidate One wins with only 29% of the vote, which means 71% of voters did not choose them. This does not give voters the sense that Candidate One has been given the mandate to lead by the people. 

This creates an opening for the winning candidate's opponents to attack their legitimacy, which hurts their ability to govern as well as the legitimacy of our elections. Since voters can only vote for a single candidate, this creates a zero-sum game that rewards the candidates who run toxic smear campaigns against their opponents.

### 2) Voters are punished for voting their values

To continue the previous example, there are five candidates running for a position. A voter may believe in Candidate Five the most but is worried that they don't have a chance of winning and may be wasting their vote.

If they go ahead and vote for Candidate Five, their friends and family could shame them for not voting for a more "electable" candidate. This lose-lose scenario can lead many voting-age citizens to stop voting and drop out of civic life altogether.

## How do we fix our elections?

The good news is there is a solution. It's called ranked choice voting (RCV).
